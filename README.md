## Salary Prediction Portfolio (Python)

### Goal 
This project aims to predict salary from job description

### Dataset Information
The dataset are split into 3 different CSV files. 1. Training data 2. Test data 3. Target variable - Salary. 

### Background
This notebook demonstrates the entire data science process of building a predictive model. To predict the salary range for job seekers, we need to capture the relevant features. I did some statistical analysis and used the in-built random forest framework to capture the importance features. 
The processes involving defining the problem, preprocessing data, EDA, developing model, and deploying into production have been divided into main sections. Salary range tends to vary, depending on many factors such as experiences, education, previous job title, etc. This predictive analysis aims to build a scalable and deployable model to predict salary based on different factors.
